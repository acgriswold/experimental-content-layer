## TL;DR

This boilerplate code powers developers to ensure type safety without potential type missmatches.

```ts
// Helper method provides a safer way to narrow the type.
export const is = <T, TParent extends T>(fn: (t: T) => TParent | undefined) => {
    return (t: T): t is TParent => typeof fn(t) !== "undefined";
}

// Can't get away from a classic 'foo | bar' example
export const isFoo = is<Foo, Bar>(
    foo => foo._tag === "Foo" ? foo : undefined
)
```

## What is a type guard?

A standard type _**User-Defined Type Guard (UDTG)**_ allows too much flexibility when "enforcing" types.  Look at the code example below.

```ts
const isBurger = (food: Food): food is Burger => food._tag === "Hotdog";
```

Notice the issue?  We are checking for `_tag === "Hotdog"`, leading to potential run time errors.

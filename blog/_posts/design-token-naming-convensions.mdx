## Concept
Design tokens have become the foundation design systems and the building blocks of reusable and maintainable visual styles.
Legible and digestible names increase in demained to improve and sustain a team's shared understanding whil transitions through
design, code, and other disciplinary handoffs.

### Breakdown
Names should be all of the following

- Legible
- Quickly Recognizable
- Purposeful


### Pattern
Token naming is hard. Building a token schema breaks down the need for individuality when naming tokens, 
leading to a more global understanding of the task.

Within my team, we have broken down our naming to its bare `component`, `category`, `property`, `attribute`, 
`relationship`, and `state` -- following that same order.  `System` is prepended to all tokens for clarity.

For example `$global-color-neutral-42` token combines four levels -- _namespace or system_ (in this example, `global` is 
the parent design system), _category_, _varient_, and _scale_.

- `Base` levels as a tokenâ€™s backbone that combine category (for example, color), concept (action) and property (size).
- `Modifier` levels to refer to one or more of variant (primary), state (hover), scale (100), and mode (on-dark).
- `Object` levels to refer to a component (button), element within a component (left-icon), or component group (forms).
- `Namespace` levels combining any (or all, in extreme cases!) of system (esds), theme (ocean or subbrand), or domain (retail).

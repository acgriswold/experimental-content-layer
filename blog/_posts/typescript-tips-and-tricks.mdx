## Introduction

TypeScript is an open-source programming language that has taken over as the standard for starting any JavaScript-based project. It adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. I've started compiling a collection of tips and interesting usecases of this language to keep me inspired before dropping it's seemingly insurmountable practices.

## The Basics

### Types

Types are crucial when learning TypeScript and allows developers to specify the data types of variables, function parameters, and return types. This can help catch before releasing them to production.

For example.

```ts
type Links = {
    portfolio?: string,
    github?: string,
    linkedin?: string
}

type Author = {
    name: string,
    age: number,
    meta: Links
}
```

### Interfaces

Interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. They specify the names and types of the objectâ€™s properties and can be used to enforce consistency across multiple objects.

For example.

```ts
interface Person { name: string; age: number; }
```

This defines an interface for a `Person` object with a `name` property of type `string` and an `age` property of type `number`.

### Enums

Enums are a way to define a set of named values. They can improve code readability and help catch errors.

For example.

```ts
enum Action {
    Default,
    Stationary,
    Transfer
}
```

### Classes

Classes allow develoeprs to define blueprints for objects that all share the same properties and methods.

For example.

```ts
class Animal {
    name: string,
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name
    }
}
```

### Generics

Generics are used to create repeatable patterns that are not concerned with a single type. This create type safe code while allowing for better flexibility with the data used.

For example.

```ts
function Wrapper<T>(arg: T): () => T {
    return () => arg;
}
```

### Unions and Intersections

Union types allow for the combination of two or more data types into one. This can be useful when a function or variable can accept multiple types of data.

For example.

```ts

```



## As Const!!
As const is powerful and ensures that none of the attributes (even when nested) can be changed. Combine this with
typescripts ability to grab keys and types, you can dynimcally generate union values to ensure your source of
truth never changes.


```ts
const routes = {
  home: "/",
  admin: "/admin",
  user: "/users",
} as const


// "home" | "admin" | "user"
type RouteKeys = keyof typeof routes

// "/" | "admin" | "user"
type Route = (typeof routes)[RouteKeys]

const goToRoute = (route: Route) => {
  // ... truncated for example
}

goToRoute(/** "/" | "admin" | "user" */)
```



## Examples

### Utility Types

- `Omit<Type, Keys>`

### Keys

```ts
function getObjectProps<Obj, Key extends keyof Obj>(obj: Obj, key: Key): Obj[Key] {
    return obj[key]
}


const user = {
    name: "at-adam",
    site: "https://google.com"
}

getObjectProps(user, "site") // Argument enforced to be "name" | "site"
```
